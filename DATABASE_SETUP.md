# 🗄️ Database Setup Instructions

## Your Supabase credentials are now configured! ✅

The app is ready to connect to your Supabase project. Now you need to set up the database schema.

## Set up Database Schema

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [your Supabase project dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
2. Click on your project: `ayzzpjjyhkrctjcklety`

### Step 2: Run Database Schema
1. In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **SQL Editor** (in the left sidebar)
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Copy the entire contents of the file `supabase-schema.sql` in your project
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click **"RUN"** to execute the schema

### What this creates:
- ✅ **users** table - For user profiles  
- ✅ **clothing_items** table - For storing clothing items
- ✅ **Row Level Security** policies - Secure data access
- ✅ **Indexes** - Fast database queries
- ✅ **Triggers** - Automatic timestamp updates

### Step 3: Test the Application
1. Your app is running at: http://localhost:8080/
2. Try creating an account by clicking "Get Started" → "Register"
3. Once logged in, try adding a clothing item using the "+" button
4. View your items in the "My Listings" tab on the dashboard

## Features Now Available:
- 🔐 **User Registration & Login**
- 👕 **Add Clothing Items** with images, descriptions, and details
- 📱 **View Your Listings** in real-time
- 🔒 **Secure Data** - Each user only sees their own items
- ⚡ **Real-time Updates** - Changes appear instantly

## Troubleshooting:
- If you get authentication errors, double-check the SQL schema was run successfully
- If images don't upload, that's normal - we're using placeholder URLs for now
- Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages

Your swap-threads application is now fully functional! 🎉
